# Google Java Format  
These settings are meant to be imported in IntelliJ. They are based on [google/google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) and include the following changes:
- In general and for Java
    - `INDENT_SIZE` = 4
    - `TAB_SIZE` = 4
    - `CONTINUATION_INDENT_SIZE` = 8
- For Java only
    - `GENERATE_FINAL_LOCALS` = true
    - `GENERATE_FINAL_PARAMETERS` = true

To import the settings open: `File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style`. 
Then click on the cog icon right after the `Scheme` selector and then `Import Scheme -> IntelliJ IDEA code style XML`.
